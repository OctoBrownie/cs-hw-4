I had an idea to implement different AIs with different algorithms and randomly pick
one for the user to use. It would've been really funny to see people react to their AI
doing really dumb things or not. The ideas I had were these:

- random AI, so the one I've already implemented
- myopic AI, which only checks for things in the immediate vicinity (for TAs and skills)
- farsight AI, which would go for the closest skills to the instructor (minimize moves),
	assuming it knew where the instructor was (hidden in the fog)
- suicidal AI, which would seek out the nearest TA and run into them

However... I didn't have time to implement them. I tried thinking about how exactly to do
it, and I thought about cost functions to evaluate each move. Then we use the costs to 
either just use the best one or as weights for a random decision.
